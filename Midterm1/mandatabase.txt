NAME
       ls - list directory contents

SYNOPSIS
       ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).  Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --all
              do not ignore entries starting with .

       -A, --almost-all
              do not list implied . and ..

       --author
              with -l, print the author of each file

       -b, --escape
              print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters

       --block-size=SIZE
              scale sizes by SIZE before printing them; e.g., '--block-size=M' prints sizes in units of 1,048,576 bytes; see SIZE format below

       -B, --ignore-backups
              do not list implied entries ending with ~

       -c     with -lt: sort by, and show, ctime (time of last modification of file status information); with -l: show ctime and sort by name; otherwise: sort by ctime, newest first

       -C     list entries by columns

       --color[=WHEN]
              colorize the output; WHEN can be 'never', 'auto', or 'always' (the default); more info below

       -d, --directory
              list directories themselves, not their contents

       -D, --dired
              generate output designed for Emacs' dired mode

       -f     do not sort, enable -aU, disable -ls --color

       -F, --classify
              append indicator (one of */=>@|) to entries

       --file-type

       --group-directories-first
              group directories before files;

              can be augmented with a --sort option, but any use of --sort=none (-U) disables grouping

       -G, --no-group
              in a long listing, don't print group names

       -h, --human-readable
              with -l, print sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)

       --si   likewise, but use powers of 1000 not 1024

       -H, --dereference-command-line
              follow symbolic links listed on the command line

       --dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir

       -l     use a long listing format

       -L, --dereference
              when showing file information for a symbolic link, show information for the file the link references rather than for the link itself

       -m     fill width with a comma separated list of entries

       -n, --numeric-uid-gid
              like -l, but list numeric user and group IDs

              append / indicator to directories

       -q, --hide-control-chars
              print ? instead of nongraphic characters

       --show-control-chars
              show nongraphic characters as-is (the default, unless program is 'ls' and output is a terminal)

       -Q, --quote-name
              enclose entry names in double quotes

       --quoting-style=WORD
              use quoting style WORD for entry names: literal, locale, shell, shell-always, c, escape

       -r, --reverse
              reverse order while sorting

       -R, --recursive
              list subdirectories recursively

       -s, --size
              print the allocated size of each file, in blocks

       -S     sort by file size

       --sort=WORD
              sort by WORD instead of name: none (-U), size (-S), time (-t), version (-v), extension (-X)

       --time=WORD
              with -l, show time as WORD instead of default modification time: atime or access or use (-u) ctime or status (-c); also use specified time as sort key if --sort=time

       --time-style=STYLE
              with  -l, show times using style STYLE: full-iso, long-iso, iso, locale, or +FORMAT; FORMAT is interpreted like in 'date'; if FORMAT is FORMAT1<newline>FORMAT2, then FORMAT1 applies to
              non-recent files and FORMAT2 to recent files; if STYLE is prefixed with 'posix-', STYLE takes effect only outside the POSIX locale

       -t     sort by modification time, newest first

       -T, --tabsize=COLS
              assume tab stops at each COLS instead of 8

       -u     with -lt: sort by, and show, access time; with -l: show access time and sort by name; otherwise: sort by access time

       -U     do not sort; list entries in directory order

       -v     natural sort of (version) numbers within text

       -w, --width=COLS
              assume screen width instead of current value

       -x     list entries by lines instead of by columns

       -X     sort alphabetically by entry extension

       -1     list one file per line

       SELinux options:

       --lcontext
              Display security context.   Enable -l. Lines will probably be too wide for most displays.

       -Z, --context
              Display security context so it fits on most displays.  Displays only mode, user, group, security context and file name.

       --scontext
              Display only security context and file name.

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       SIZE is an integer and optional unit (example: 10M is 10*1024*1024).  Units are K, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y (powers of 1024) or KB, MB, ... (powers of 1000).

       Using color to distinguish file types is disabled both by default and with --color=never.  With --color=auto, ls emits color codes only when standard output is connected to a  terminal.   The
       LS_COLORS environment variable can change the settings.  Use the dircolors command to set it.

   Exit status:
       0      if OK,

       1      if minor problems (e.g., cannot access subdirectory),

       2      if serious trouble (e.g., cannot access command-line argument).

       man [-?V]

DESCRIPTION
       man is the system's manual pager. Each page argument given to man is normally the name of a program, utility or function.  The manual page associated with each  of  these  arguments  is  then
       found  and  displayed.  A section, if provided, will direct man to look only in that section of the manual.  The default action is to search in all of the available sections, following a pre-
       defined order and to show only the first page found, even if page exists in several sections.

       The table below shows the section numbers of the manual followed by the types of pages they contain.


       1   Executable programs or shell commands
       2   System calls (functions provided by the kernel)
       3   Library calls (functions within program libraries)
       4   Special files (usually found in /dev)
       5   File formats and conventions eg /etc/passwd
       6   Games
       7   Miscellaneous (including macro packages and conventions), e.g. man(7), groff(7)
       8   System administration commands (usually only for root)
       9   Kernel routines [Non standard]

       A manual page consists of several sections.

       Conventional section names include NAME, SYNOPSIS, CONFIGURATION, DESCRIPTION, OPTIONS, EXIT STATUS, RETURN VALUE, ERRORS, ENVIRONMENT, FILES, VERSIONS, CONFORMING TO, NOTES,  BUGS,  EXAMPLE,
       AUTHORS, and SEE ALSO.

       The following conventions apply to the SYNOPSIS section and can be used as a guide in other sections.


       bold text          type exactly as shown.
       italic text        replace with appropriate argument.
       [-abc]             any or all arguments within [ ] are optional.
       -a|-b              options delimited by | cannot be used together.
       argument ...       argument is repeatable.
       [expression] ...   entire expression within [ ] is repeatable.

       Exact  rendering  may  vary  depending  on  the  output  device.  For instance, man will usually not be able to render italics when running in a terminal, and will typically use underlined or
       coloured text instead.

       The command or function illustration is a pattern that should match all possible invocations.  In some cases it is advisable to illustrate several exclusive invocations as  is  shown  in  the
       SYNOPSIS section of this manual page.

EXAMPLES
       man ls
           Display the manual page for the item (program) ls.

       man -a intro
           Display, in succession, all of the available intro manual pages contained within the manual.  It is possible to quit between successive displays or skip any of them.

       man -t alias | lpr -Pps
           Format  the  manual  page  referenced by `alias', usually a shell manual page, into the default troff or groff format and pipe it to the printer named ps.  The default output for groff is
           usually PostScript.  man --help should advise as to which processor is bound to the -t option.

       man -l -Tdvi ./foo.1x.gz > ./foo.1x.dvi
           This command will decompress and format the nroff source manual page ./foo.1x.gz into a device independent (dvi) file.  The redirection is necessary as the -T flag  causes  output  to  be
           directed to stdout with no pager.  The output could be viewed with a program such as xdvi or further processed into PostScript using a program such as dvips.

       man -k printf
           Search the short descriptions and manual page names for the keyword printf as regular expression.  Print out any matches.  Equivalent to apropos -r printf.

       man -f smail
           Lookup the manual pages referenced by smail and print out the short descriptions of any found.  Equivalent to whatis -r smail.

OVERVIEW
       Many  options are available to man in order to give as much flexibility as possible to the user.  Changes can be made to the search path, section order, output processor, and other behaviours
       and operations detailed below.

       If set, various environment variables are interrogated to determine the operation of man.  It is possible to set the `catch all' variable $MANOPT to any string in command line format with the
       exception that any spaces used as part of an option's argument must be escaped (preceded by a backslash).  man will parse $MANOPT prior to parsing its own command line.  Those options requir‐
       ing an argument will be overridden by the same options found on the command line.  To reset all of the options set in $MANOPT, -D can be specified as the initial command  line  option.   This
       will allow man to `forget' about the options specified in $MANOPT although they must still have been valid.

       The  manual pager utilities packaged as man-db make extensive use of index database caches.  These caches contain information such as where each manual page can be found on the filesystem and
       what its whatis (short one line description of the man page) contains, and allow man to run faster than if it had to search the filesystem each time to find the appropriate manual  page.   If
       requested using the -u option, man will ensure that the caches remain consistent, which can obviate the need to manually run software to update traditional whatis text databases.

       If  man  cannot  find a mandb initiated index database for a particular manual page hierarchy, it will still search for the requested manual pages, although file globbing will be necessary to
       search within that hierarchy.  If whatis or apropos fails to find an index it will try to extract information from a traditional whatis database instead.

       These utilities support compressed source nroff files having, by default, the extensions of .Z, .z and .gz.  It is possible to deal with any compression extension, but this  information  must
       be  known  at  compile  time.   Also,  by default, any cat pages produced are compressed using gzip.  Each `global' manual page hierarchy such as /usr/share/man or /usr/X11R6/man may have any
       directory as its cat page hierarchy.  Traditionally the cat pages are stored under the same hierarchy as the man pages, but for reasons such as those specified in the File Hierarchy  Standard
       (FHS), it may be better to store them elsewhere.  For details on how to do this, please read manpath(5).  For details on why to do this, read the standard.

       International  support is available with this package.  Native language manual pages are accessible (if available on your system) via use of locale functions.  To activate such support, it is
       necessary to set either $LC_MESSAGES, $LANG or another system dependent environment variable to your language locale, usually specified in the POSIX 1003.1 based format:

       <language>[_<territory>[.<character-set>[,<version>]]]

       If the desired page is available in your locale, it will be displayed in lieu of the standard (usually American English) page.

       Support for international message catalogues is also featured in this package and can be activated in the same way, again if available.  If you find that the manual pages  and  message  cata‐
       logues supplied with this package are not available in your native language and you would like to supply them, please contact the maintainer who will be coordinating such activity.

       For information regarding other features and extensions available with this manual pager, please read the documents supplied with the package.

DEFAULTS
       man will search for the desired manual pages within the index database caches. If the -u option is given, a cache consistency check is performed to ensure the databases accurately reflect the
       filesystem.  If this option is always given, it is not generally necessary to run mandb after the caches are initially created, unless a cache becomes corrupt.  However, the cache consistency
       check  can be slow on systems with many manual pages installed, so it is not performed by default, and system administrators may wish to run mandb every week or so to keep the database caches
       fresh.  To forestall problems caused by outdated caches, man will fall back to file globbing if a cache lookup fails, just as it would if no cache was present.

       Once a manual page has been located, a check is performed to find out if a relative preformatted `cat' file already exists and is newer than the nroff file.  If it does and is,  this  prefor‐
       matted  file  is (usually) decompressed and then displayed, via use of a pager.  The pager can be specified in a number of ways, or else will fall back to a default is used (see option -P for
       details).  If no cat is found or is older than the nroff file, the nroff is filtered through various programs and is shown immediately.

       If a cat file can be produced (a relative cat directory exists and has appropriate permissions), man will compress and store the cat file in the background.

       The filters are deciphered by a number of means. Firstly, the command line option -p or the environment variable $MANROFFSEQ is interrogated. If -p was not used and the  environment  variable
       was not set, the initial line of the nroff file is parsed for a preprocessor string.  To contain a valid preprocessor string, the first line must resemble

       '\" <string>

       where string can be any combination of letters described by option -p below.

       If none of the above methods provide any filter information, a default set is used.

       A  formatting  pipeline  is formed from the filters and the primary formatter (nroff or [tg]roff with -t) and executed.  Alternatively, if an executable program mandb_nfmt (or mandb_tfmt with
       -t) exists in the man tree root, it is executed instead.  It gets passed the manual source file, the preprocessor string, and optionally the device specified with -T or -E as arguments.

OPTIONS
       Non argument options that are duplicated either on the command line, in $MANOPT, or both, are not harmful.  For options that require an argument, each duplication will override  the  previous
       argument value.

   General options
       -C file, --config-file=file
              Use this user configuration file rather than the default of ~/.manpath.

       -d, --debug
              Print debugging information.

       -D, --default
              This  option  is  normally issued as the very first option and resets man's behaviour to its default.  Its use is to reset those options that may have been set in $MANOPT.  Any options
              that follow -D will have their usual effect.

       --warnings[=warnings]
              Enable warnings from groff.  This may be used to perform sanity checks on the source text of manual pages.  warnings is a comma-separated list of warning names; if it is not  supplied,
              the default is "mac".  See the “Warnings” node in info groff for a list of available warning names.

   Main modes of operation
       -f, --whatis
              Equivalent to whatis.  Display a short description from the manual page, if available. See whatis(1) for details.

       -k, --apropos
              Equivalent to apropos.  Search the short manual page descriptions for keywords and display any matches.  See apropos(1) for details.

       -K, --global-apropos
              Search for text in all manual pages.  This is a brute-force search, and is likely to take some time; if you can, you should specify a section to reduce the number of pages that need to
              be searched.  Search terms may be simple strings (the default), or regular expressions if the --regex option is used.

       -l, --local-file
              Activate `local' mode.  Format and display local manual files instead of searching through the system's manual collection.  Each manual page argument will be interpreted  as  an  nroff
              source  file in the correct format.  No cat file is produced.  If '-' is listed as one of the arguments, input will be taken from stdin.  When this option is not used, and man fails to
              find the page required, before displaying the error message, it attempts to act as if this option was supplied, using the name as a filename and looking for an exact match.

       -w, --where, --path, --location
              Don't actually display the manual pages, but do print the location(s) of the source nroff files that would be formatted.

       -W, --where-cat, --location-cat
              Don't actually display the manual pages, but do print the location(s) of the cat files that would be displayed.  If -w and -W are both specified, print both separated by a space.

       -c, --catman
              This option is not for general use and should only be used by the catman program.

       -R encoding, --recode=encoding
              Instead of formatting the manual page in the usual way, output its source converted to the specified encoding.  If you already know the encoding of the source file, you  can  also  use
              manconv(1)  directly.   However, this option allows you to convert several manual pages to a single encoding without having to explicitly state the encoding of each, provided that they
              were already installed in a structure similar to a manual page hierarchy.

   Finding manual pages
       -L locale, --locale=locale
              man will normally determine your current locale by a call to the C function setlocale(3) which interrogates various environment variables, possibly including  $LC_MESSAGES  and  $LANG.
              To  temporarily override the determined value, use this option to supply a locale string directly to man.  Note that it will not take effect until the search for pages actually begins.
              Output such as the help message will always be displayed in the initially determined locale.

       -m system[,...], --systems=system[,...]
              If this system has access to other operating system's manual pages, they can be accessed using this option.  To search for a manual page from NewOS's manual page  collection,  use  the
              option -m NewOS.

              The  system specified can be a combination of comma delimited operating system names.  To include a search of the native operating system's manual pages, include the system name man in
              the argument string.  This option will override the $SYSTEM environment variable.

       -M path, --manpath=path
              Specify an alternate manpath to use.  By default, man uses manpath derived code to determine the path to search.  This option overrides the $MANPATH  environment  variable  and  causes
              option -m to be ignored.

              A  path  specified as a manpath must be the root of a manual page hierarchy structured into sections as described in the man-db manual (under "The manual page system").  To view manual
              pages outside such hierarchies, see the -l option.

       -S list, -s list, --sections=list
              List is a colon- or comma-separated list of `order specific' manual sections to search.  This option overrides the $MANSECT environment variable.  (The -s spelling is for compatibility
              with System V.)

       -e sub-extension, --extension=sub-extension
              Some  systems  incorporate  large  packages of manual pages, such as those that accompany the Tcl package, into the main manual page hierarchy.  To get around the problem of having two
              manual pages with the same name such as exit(3), the Tcl pages were usually all assigned to section l.  As this is unfortunate, it is now possible to put the pages in the correct  sec‐
              tion,  and  to assign a specific `extension' to them, in this case, exit(3tcl).  Under normal operation, man will display exit(3) in preference to exit(3tcl).  To negotiate this situa‐
              tion and to avoid having to know which section the page you require resides in, it is now possible to give man a sub-extension string indicating which package the page must belong  to.
              Using the above example, supplying the option -e tcl to man will restrict the search to pages having an extension of *tcl.

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case when searching for manual pages.  This is the default.

       -I, --match-case
              Search for manual pages case-sensitively.

       --regex
              Show  all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument as a regular expression, as with apropos(1).  Since there is usually no reasonable
              way to pick a "best" page when searching for a regular expression, this option implies -a.

       --wildcard
              Show all pages with any part of either their names or their descriptions matching each page argument using shell-style wildcards, as with apropos(1) --wildcard.  The page argument must
              match  the  entire  name  or description, or match on word boundaries in the description.  Since there is usually no reasonable way to pick a "best" page when searching for a wildcard,
              this option implies -a.

       --names-only
              If the --regex or --wildcard option is used, match only page names, not page descriptions, as with whatis(1).  Otherwise, no effect.

       -a, --all
              By default, man will exit after displaying the most suitable manual page it finds.  Using this option forces man to display all the manual pages with names that match the search crite‐
              ria.

       -u, --update
              This  option  causes man to perform an `inode level' consistency check on its database caches to ensure that they are an accurate representation of the filesystem.  It will only have a
              useful effect if man is installed with the setuid bit set.

       --no-subpages
              By default, man will try to interpret pairs of manual page names given on the command line as equivalent to a single manual page name containing a hyphen or an underscore.   This  sup‐
              ports  the  common pattern of programs that implement a number of subcommands, allowing them to provide manual pages for each that can be accessed using similar syntax as would be used
              to invoke the subcommands themselves.  For example:

                $ man -aw git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git-diff.1.gz

              To disable this behaviour, use the --no-subpages option.

                $ man -aw --no-subpages git diff
                /usr/share/man/man1/git.1.gz
                /usr/share/man/man3/Git.3pm.gz
                /usr/share/man/man1/diff.1.gz

   Controlling formatted output
       -P pager, --pager=pager
              Specify which output pager to use.  By default, man uses less -s.  This option overrides the $MANPAGER environment variable, which in turn overrides the  $PAGER  environment  variable.
              It is not used in conjunction with -f or -k.

              The  value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).  It may not use pipes to connect multiple
              commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an argument or on standard input.

       -r prompt, --prompt=prompt
              If a recent version of less is used as the pager, man will attempt to set its prompt and some sensible options.  The default prompt looks like

               Manual page name(sec) line x

              where name denotes the manual page name, sec denotes the section it was found under and x the current line number.  This is achieved by using the $LESS environment variable.

              Supplying -r with a string will override this default.  The string may contain the text $MAN_PN which will be expanded to the name of the current manual page and its section name  sur‐
              rounded by `(' and `)'.  The string used to produce the default could be expressed as

              \ Manual\ page\ \$MAN_PN\ ?ltline\ %lt?L/%L.:
              byte\ %bB?s/%s..?\ (END):?pB\ %pB\\%..
              (press h for help or q to quit)

              It  is  broken  into  three  lines  here for the sake of readability only.  For its meaning see the less(1) manual page.  The prompt string is first evaluated by the shell.  All double
              quotes, back-quotes and backslashes in the prompt must be escaped by a preceding backslash.  The prompt string may end in an escaped $ which may be  followed  by  further  options  for
              less.  By default man sets the -ix8 options.

              If you want to override man's prompt string processing completely, use the $MANLESS environment variable described below.

       -7, --ascii
              When viewing a pure ascii(7) manual page on a 7 bit terminal or terminal emulator, some characters may not display correctly when using the latin1(7) device description with GNU nroff.
              This option allows pure ascii manual pages to be displayed in ascii with the latin1 device.  It will not translate any latin1 text.  The following table  shows  the  translations  per‐
              formed: some parts of it may only be displayed properly when using GNU nroff's latin1(7) device.


              Description           Octal   latin1   ascii
              ─────────────────────────────────────────────
              continuation hyphen    255      ‐        -
              bullet (middle dot)    267      ·        o
              acute accent           264      ´        '
              multiplication sign    327      ×        x

              If  the  latin1  column  displays correctly, your terminal may be set up for latin1 characters and this option is not necessary.  If the latin1 and ascii columns are identical, you are
              reading this page using this option or man did not format this page using the latin1 device description.  If the latin1 column is missing or corrupt, you may need to view manual  pages
              with this option.

              This option is ignored when using options -t, -H, -T, or -Z and may be useless for nroff other than GNU's.

       -E encoding, --encoding=encoding
              Generate output for a character encoding other than the default.  For backward compatibility, encoding may be an nroff device such as ascii, latin1, or utf8 as well as a true character
              encoding such as UTF-8.

       --no-hyphenation, --nh
              Normally, nroff will automatically hyphenate text at line breaks even in words that do not contain hyphens, if it is necessary to do so to lay out words on  a  line  without  excessive
              spacing.  This option disables automatic hyphenation, so words will only be hyphenated if they already contain hyphens.

              If  you  are  writing  a  manual  page  and  simply want to prevent nroff from hyphenating a word at an inappropriate point, do not use this option, but consult the nroff documentation
              instead; for instance, you can put "\%" inside a word to indicate that it may be hyphenated at that point, or put "\%" at the start of a word to prevent it from being hyphenated.

       --no-justification, --nj
              Normally, nroff will automatically justify text to both margins.  This option disables full justification, leaving justified only to the left margin,  sometimes  called  "ragged-right"
              text.

              If you are writing a manual page and simply want to prevent nroff from justifying certain paragraphs, do not use this option, but consult the nroff documentation instead; for instance,
              you can use the ".na", ".nf", ".fi", and ".ad" requests to temporarily disable adjusting and filling.

       -p string, --preprocessor=string
              Specify the sequence of preprocessors to run before nroff or troff/groff.  Not all installations will have a full set of preprocessors.  Some of the preprocessors and the letters  used
              to designate them are: eqn (e), grap (g), pic (p), tbl (t), vgrind (v), refer (r).  This option overrides the $MANROFFSEQ environment variable.  zsoelim is always run as the very first
              preprocessor.

       -t, --troff
              Use groff -mandoc to format the manual page to stdout.  This option is not required in conjunction with -H, -T, or -Z.

       -T[device], --troff-device[=device]
              This option is used to change groff (or possibly troff's) output to be suitable for a device other than the default.  It implies -t.  Examples (provided with Groff-1.17)  include  dvi,
              latin1, ps, utf8, X75 and X100.

       -H[browser], --html[=browser]
              This option will cause groff to produce HTML output, and will display that output in a web browser.  The choice of browser is determined by the optional browser argument if one is pro‐
              vided, by the $BROWSER environment variable, or by a compile-time default if that is unset (usually lynx).  This option implies -t, and will only work with GNU troff.

       -X[dpi], --gxditview[=dpi]
              This option displays the output of groff in a graphical window using the gxditview program.  The dpi (dots per inch) may be 75, 75-12, 100, or 100-12, defaulting to 75; the  -12  vari‐
              ants use a 12-point base font.  This option implies -T with the X75, X75-12, X100, or X100-12 device respectively.

       -Z, --ditroff
              groff  will  run  troff and then use an appropriate post-processor to produce output suitable for the chosen device.  If groff -mandoc is groff, this option is passed to groff and will
              suppress the use of a post-processor.  It implies -t.

   Getting help
       -?, --help
              Print a help message and exit.

       --usage
              Print a short usage message and exit.

       -V, --version
              Display version information.

EXIT STATUS
       0      Successful program execution.

       1      Usage, syntax or configuration file error.

       2      Operational error.

       3      A child process returned a non-zero exit status.

       16     At least one of the pages/files/keywords didn't exist or wasn't matched.

ENVIRONMENT
       MANPATH
              If $MANPATH is set, its value is used as the path to search for manual pages.

       MANROFFOPT
              The contents of $MANROFFOPT are added to the command line every time man invokes the formatter (nroff, troff, or groff).

       MANROFFSEQ
              If $MANROFFSEQ is set, its value is used to determine the set of preprocessors to pass each manual page through.  The default preprocessor list is system dependent.

       MANSECT
              If $MANSECT is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of sections and it is used to determine which manual sections to search and in what order.

       MANPAGER, PAGER
              If $MANPAGER or $PAGER is set ($MANPAGER is used in preference), its value is used as the name of the program used to display the manual page.  By default, less -s is used.

              The value may be a simple command name or a command with arguments, and may use shell quoting (backslashes, single quotes, or double quotes).  It may not use pipes to connect  multiple
              commands; if you need that, use a wrapper script, which may take the file to display either as an argument or on standard input.

       MANLESS
              If  $MANLESS  is set, man will not perform any of its usual processing to set up a prompt string for the less pager.  Instead, the value of $MANLESS will be copied verbatim into $LESS.
              For example, if you want to set the prompt string unconditionally to “my prompt string”, set $MANLESS to ‘-Psmy prompt string’.

       BROWSER
              If $BROWSER is set, its value is a colon-delimited list of commands, each of which in turn is used to try to start a web browser for man --html.  In each command, %s is replaced  by  a
              filename containing the HTML output from groff, %% is replaced by a single percent sign (%), and %c is replaced by a colon (:).

       SYSTEM If $SYSTEM is set, it will have the same effect as if it had been specified as the argument to the -m option.

       MANOPT If  $MANOPT is set, it will be parsed prior to man's command line and is expected to be in a similar format.  As all of the other man specific environment variables can be expressed as
              command line options, and are thus candidates for being included in $MANOPT it is expected that they will become obsolete.  N.B. All spaces that should be interpreted  as  part  of  an
              option's argument must be escaped.

       MANWIDTH
              If  $MANWIDTH  is set, its value is used as the line length for which manual pages should be formatted.  If it is not set, manual pages will be formatted with a line length appropriate
              to the current terminal (using an ioctl(2) if available, the value of $COLUMNS, or falling back to 80 characters if neither is available).  Cat  pages  will  only  be  saved  when  the
              default formatting can be used, that is when the terminal line length is between 66 and 80 characters.

       MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING
              Normally, when output is not being directed to a terminal (such as to a file or a pipe), formatting characters are discarded to make it easier to read the result without special tools.
              However, if $MAN_KEEP_FORMATTING is set to any non-empty value, these formatting characters are retained.  This may be useful for wrappers around  man  that  can  interpret  formatting
              characters.

       MAN_KEEP_STDERR
              Normally,  when  output is being directed to a terminal (usually to a pager), any error output from the command used to produce formatted versions of manual pages is discarded to avoid
              interfering with the pager's display.  Programs such as groff often produce relatively minor error messages about typographical problems such as poor alignment, which are unsightly and
              generally confusing when displayed along with the manual page.  However, some users want to see them anyway, so, if $MAN_KEEP_STDERR is set to any non-empty value, error output will be
              displayed as usual.

       LANG, LC_MESSAGES
              Depending on system and implementation, either or both of $LANG and $LC_MESSAGES will be interrogated for the current message locale.  man will display its messages in that locale  (if
              available).  See setlocale(3) for precise details.

FILES
       /etc/man_db.conf
              man-db configuration file.

       /usr/share/man
              A global manual page hierarchy.

       /usr/share/man/index.(bt|db|dir|pag)

NAME
       grep, egrep, fgrep - print lines matching a pattern

SYNOPSIS
       grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN [FILE...]
       grep [OPTIONS] [-e PATTERN | -f FILE] [FILE...]

DESCRIPTION
       grep  searches  the  named  input FILEs (or standard input if no files are named, or if a single hyphen-minus (-) is given as file name) for lines containing a match to the given PATTERN.  By
       default, grep prints the matching lines.

       In addition, two variant programs egrep and fgrep are available.  egrep is the same as grep -E.  fgrep is the same as grep -F.  Direct invocation as either egrep or fgrep is  deprecated,  but
       is provided to allow historical applications that rely on them to run unmodified.

OPTIONS
   Generic Program Information
       --help Print a usage message briefly summarizing these command-line options and the bug-reporting address, then exit.

       -V, --version
              Print the version number of grep to the standard output stream.  This version number should be included in all bug reports (see below).

   Matcher Selection
       -E, --extended-regexp
              Interpret PATTERN as an extended regular expression (ERE, see below).  (-E is specified by POSIX.)

       -F, --fixed-strings, --fixed-regexp
              Interpret  PATTERN as a list of fixed strings, separated by newlines, any of which is to be matched.  (-F is specified by POSIX, --fixed-regexp is an obsoleted alias, please do not use
              it in new scripts.)

       -G, --basic-regexp
              Interpret PATTERN as a basic regular expression (BRE, see below).  This is the default.

       -P, --perl-regexp
              Interpret PATTERN as a Perl regular expression.  This is highly experimental and grep -P may warn of unimplemented features.

   Matching Control
       -e PATTERN, --regexp=PATTERN
              Use PATTERN as the pattern.  This can be used to specify multiple search patterns, or to protect a pattern beginning with a hyphen (-).  (-e is specified by POSIX.)

       -f FILE, --file=FILE
              Obtain patterns from FILE, one per line.  The empty file contains zero patterns, and therefore matches nothing.  (-f is specified by POSIX.)

       -i, --ignore-case
              Ignore case distinctions in both the PATTERN and the input files.  (-i is specified by POSIX.)

       -v, --invert-match
              Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.  (-v is specified by POSIX.)

       -w, --word-regexp
              Select only those lines containing matches that form whole words.  The test is that the matching substring must either be at the beginning of  the  line,  or  preceded  by  a  non-word
              constituent  character.   Similarly, it must be either at the end of the line or followed by a non-word constituent character.  Word-constituent characters are letters, digits, and the
              underscore.

       -x, --line-regexp
              Select only those matches that exactly match the whole line.  (-x is specified by POSIX.)

       -y     Obsolete synonym for -i.

   General Output Control
       -c, --count
              Suppress normal output; instead print a count of matching lines for each input file.  With the -v, --invert-match option (see below), count non-matching lines.   (-c  is  specified  by
              POSIX.)

       --color[=WHEN], --colour[=WHEN]
              Surround  the  matched  (non-empty)  strings, matching lines, context lines, file names, line numbers, byte offsets, and separators (for fields and groups of context lines) with escape
              sequences to display them in color on the terminal.  The colors are defined by the environment variable GREP_COLORS.  The deprecated environment variable GREP_COLOR is still supported,
              but its setting does not have priority.  WHEN is never, always, or auto.

       -L, --files-without-match
              Suppress normal output; instead print the name of each input file from which no output would normally have been printed.  The scanning will stop on the first match.

       -l, --files-with-matches
              Suppress  normal  output; instead print the name of each input file from which output would normally have been printed.  The scanning will stop on the first match.  (-l is specified by
              POSIX.)

       -m NUM, --max-count=NUM
              Stop reading a file after NUM matching lines.  If the input is standard input from a regular file, and NUM matching lines are output, grep ensures that the standard input is positioned
              to  just  after  the last matching line before exiting, regardless of the presence of trailing context lines.  This enables a calling process to resume a search.  When grep stops after
              NUM matching lines, it outputs any trailing context lines.  When the -c or --count option is also used, grep does not output a count greater than NUM.  When the  -v  or  --invert-match
              option is also used, grep stops after outputting NUM non-matching lines.

       -o, --only-matching
              Print only the matched (non-empty) parts of a matching line, with each such part on a separate output line.

       -q, --quiet, --silent
              Quiet; do not write anything to standard output.  Exit immediately with zero status if any match is found, even if an error was detected.  Also see the -s or --no-messages option.  (-q
              is specified by POSIX.)

       -s, --no-messages
              Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.  Portability note: unlike GNU grep, 7th Edition Unix grep did not conform to POSIX, because  it  lacked  -q  and  its  -s
              option  behaved  like  GNU  grep's  -q  option.   USG-style  grep also lacked -q but its -s option behaved like GNU grep.  Portable shell scripts should avoid both -q and -s and should
              redirect standard and error output to /dev/null instead.  (-s is specified by POSIX.)

   Output Line Prefix Control
       -b, --byte-offset
              Print the 0-based byte offset within the input file before each line of output.  If -o (--only-matching) is specified, print the offset of the matching part itself.

       -H, --with-filename
              Print the file name for each match.  This is the default when there is more than one file to search.

       -h, --no-filename
              Suppress the prefixing of file names on output.  This is the default when there is only one file (or only standard input) to search.

       --label=LABEL
              Display input actually coming from standard input as input coming from file LABEL.  This is especially useful when  implementing  tools  like  zgrep,  e.g.,  gzip  -cd  foo.gz  |  grep
              --label=foo -H something.  See also the -H option.

       -n, --line-number
              Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number within its input file.  (-n is specified by POSIX.)

       -T, --initial-tab
              Make  sure  that the first character of actual line content lies on a tab stop, so that the alignment of tabs looks normal.  This is useful with options that prefix their output to the
              actual content: -H,-n, and -b.  In order to improve the probability that lines from a single file will all start at the same column, this also causes the line number  and  byte  offset
              (if present) to be printed in a minimum size field width.

       -u, --unix-byte-offsets
              Report  Unix-style  byte  offsets.  This switch causes grep to report byte offsets as if the file were a Unix-style text file, i.e., with CR characters stripped off.  This will produce
              results identical to running grep on a Unix machine.  This option has no effect unless -b option is also used; it has no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.

       -Z, --null
              Output a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead of the character that normally follows a file name.  For example, grep -lZ outputs a zero byte after each file name instead of  the
              usual  newline.   This  option makes the output unambiguous, even in the presence of file names containing unusual characters like newlines.  This option can be used with commands like
              find -print0, perl -0, sort -z, and xargs -0 to process arbitrary file names, even those that contain newline characters.

   Context Line Control
       -A NUM, --after-context=NUM
              Print NUM lines of trailing context after matching lines.  Places a line containing a group separator (described under --group-separator) between contiguous groups  of  matches.   With
              the -o or --only-matching option, this has no effect and a warning is given.

       -B NUM, --before-context=NUM
              Print  NUM  lines  of leading context before matching lines.  Places a line containing a group separator (described under --group-separator) between contiguous groups of matches.  With
              the -o or --only-matching option, this has no effect and a warning is given.

       -C NUM, -NUM, --context=NUM
              Print NUM lines of output context.  Places a line containing a group separator (described under --group-separator) between contiguous groups of matches.  With the -o or --only-matching
              option, this has no effect and a warning is given.

       --group-separator=SEP
              Use SEP as a group separator. By default SEP is double hyphen (--).

       --no-group-separator
              Use empty string as a group separator.

   File and Directory Selection
       -a, --text
              Process a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent to the --binary-files=text option.

       --binary-files=TYPE
              If the first few bytes of a file indicate that the file contains binary data, assume that the file is of type TYPE.  By default, TYPE is binary, and grep normally outputs either a one-
              line message saying that a binary file matches, or no message if there is no match.  If TYPE is without-match, grep assumes that a binary file does not match; this is equivalent to the
              -I option.  If TYPE is text, grep processes a binary file as if it were text; this is equivalent to the -a option.  Warning: grep --binary-files=text might output binary garbage, which
              can have nasty side effects if the output is a terminal and if the terminal driver interprets some of it as commands.

       -D ACTION, --devices=ACTION
              If an input file is a device, FIFO or socket, use ACTION to process it.  By default, ACTION is read, which means that devices are read just as if they were ordinary files.   If  ACTION
              is skip, devices are silently skipped.

       -d ACTION, --directories=ACTION
              If  an  input  file is a directory, use ACTION to process it.  By default, ACTION is read, i.e., read directories just as if they were ordinary files.  If ACTION is skip, silently skip
              directories.  If ACTION is recurse, read all files under each directory, recursively, following symbolic links only if they are on the command line.   This  is  equivalent  to  the  -r
              option.

       --exclude=GLOB
              Skip files whose base name matches GLOB (using wildcard matching).  A file-name glob can use *, ?, and [...]  as wildcards, and \ to quote a wildcard or backslash character literally.

       --exclude-from=FILE
              Skip files whose base name matches any of the file-name globs read from FILE (using wildcard matching as described under --exclude).

       --exclude-dir=DIR
              Exclude directories matching the pattern DIR from recursive searches.

       -I     Process a binary file as if it did not contain matching data; this is equivalent to the --binary-files=without-match option.

       --include=GLOB
              Search only files whose base name matches GLOB (using wildcard matching as described under --exclude).

       -r, --recursive
              Read all files under each directory, recursively, following symbolic links only if they are on the command line.  This is equivalent to the -d recurse option.

       -R, --dereference-recursive
              Read all files under each directory, recursively.  Follow all symbolic links, unlike -r.

   Other Options
       --line-buffered
              Use line buffering on output.  This can cause a performance penalty.

       -U, --binary
              Treat  the file(s) as binary.  By default, under MS-DOS and MS-Windows, grep guesses the file type by looking at the contents of the first 32KB read from the file.  If grep decides the
              file is a text file, it strips the CR characters from the original file contents (to make regular expressions with ^ and $ work correctly).  Specifying  -U  overrules  this  guesswork,
              causing  all  files  to  be  read  and  passed  to  the  matching  mechanism verbatim; if the file is a text file with CR/LF pairs at the end of each line, this will cause some regular
              expressions to fail.  This option has no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.

       -z, --null-data
              Treat the input as a set of lines, each terminated by a zero byte (the ASCII NUL character) instead of a newline.  Like the -Z or --null option, this option can be used  with  commands
              like sort -z to process arbitrary file names.

REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
       A  regular  expression  is a pattern that describes a set of strings.  Regular expressions are constructed analogously to arithmetic expressions, by using various operators to combine smaller
       expressions.

       grep understands three different versions of regular expression syntax: “basic,” “extended” and “perl.” In GNU grep, there is no  difference  in  available  functionality  between  basic  and
       extended  syntaxes.   In  other implementations, basic regular expressions are less powerful.  The following description applies to extended regular expressions; differences for basic regular
       expressions are summarized afterwards.  Perl regular expressions give additional functionality, and are documented in pcresyntax(3) and pcrepattern(3), but  may  not  be  available  on  every
       system.

       The  fundamental  building blocks are the regular expressions that match a single character.  Most characters, including all letters and digits, are regular expressions that match themselves.
       Any meta-character with special meaning may be quoted by preceding it with a backslash.

       The period . matches any single character.

   Character Classes and Bracket Expressions
       A bracket expression is a list of characters enclosed by [ and ].  It matches any single character in that list; if the first character of the  list  is  the  caret  ^  then  it  matches  any
       character not in the list.  For example, the regular expression [0123456789] matches any single digit.

       Within  a bracket expression, a range expression consists of two characters separated by a hyphen.  It matches any single character that sorts between the two characters, inclusive, using the
       locale's collating sequence and character set.  For example, in the default C locale, [a-d] is equivalent to [abcd].  Many locales sort characters in dictionary order, and  in  these  locales
       [a-d]  is  typically  not equivalent to [abcd]; it might be equivalent to [aBbCcDd], for example.  To obtain the traditional interpretation of bracket expressions, you can use the C locale by
       setting the LC_ALL environment variable to the value C.

       Finally, certain named classes of characters are predefined within bracket expressions, as follows.  Their names are self explanatory, and they are [:alnum:], [:alpha:], [:cntrl:], [:digit:],
       [:graph:],  [:lower:],  [:print:],  [:punct:], [:space:], [:upper:], and [:xdigit:].  For example, [[:alnum:]] means the character class of numbers and letters in the current locale. In the C
       locale and ASCII character set encoding, this is the same as [0-9A-Za-z].  (Note that the brackets in these class names are part of the symbolic names, and must be included in addition to the
       brackets  delimiting  the  bracket expression.)  Most meta-characters lose their special meaning inside bracket expressions.  To include a literal ] place it first in the list.  Similarly, to
       include a literal ^ place it anywhere but first.  Finally, to include a literal - place it last.

   Anchoring
       The caret ^ and the dollar sign $ are meta-characters that respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a line.

   The Backslash Character and Special Expressions
       The symbols \< and \> respectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a word.  The symbol \b matches the empty string at the edge of a word, and \B matches  the  empty  string
       provided it's not at the edge of a word.  The symbol \w is a synonym for [_[:alnum:]] and \W is a synonym for [^_[:alnum:]].

   Repetition
       A regular expression may be followed by one of several repetition operators:
       ?      The preceding item is optional and matched at most once.
       *      The preceding item will be matched zero or more times.
       +      The preceding item will be matched one or more times.
       {n}    The preceding item is matched exactly n times.
       {n,}   The preceding item is matched n or more times.
       {,m}   The preceding item is matched at most m times.  This is a GNU extension.
       {n,m}  The preceding item is matched at least n times, but not more than m times.

   Concatenation
       Two regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting regular expression matches any string formed by concatenating two substrings that respectively match the concatenated expressions.

   Alternation
       Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator |; the resulting regular expression matches any string matching either alternate expression.

   Precedence
       Repetition takes precedence over concatenation, which in turn takes precedence over alternation.  A whole expression may be enclosed in parentheses to override these precedence rules and form
       a subexpression.

   Back References and Subexpressions
       The back-reference \n, where n is a single digit, matches the substring previously matched by the nth parenthesized subexpression of the regular expression.

   Basic vs Extended Regular Expressions
       In basic regular expressions the meta-characters ?, +, {, |, (, and ) lose their special meaning; instead use the backslashed versions \?, \+, \{, \|, \(, and \).

       Traditional egrep did not support the { meta-character, and some egrep implementations support \{ instead, so portable scripts should avoid { in grep -E patterns and should use [{] to match a
       literal {.

       GNU  grep -E  attempts  to  support  traditional  usage by assuming that { is not special if it would be the start of an invalid interval specification.  For example, the command grep -E '{1'
       searches for the two-character string {1 instead of reporting a syntax error in the regular expression.  POSIX allows this behavior as an extension, but portable scripts should avoid it.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       The behavior of grep is affected by the following environment variables.

       The locale for category LC_foo is specified by examining the three environment variables LC_ALL, LC_foo, LANG, in that order.  The first of these variables that is set specifies  the  locale.
       For  example,  if  LC_ALL  is  not  set,  but  LC_MESSAGES  is  set to pt_BR, then the Brazilian Portuguese locale is used for the LC_MESSAGES category.  The C locale is used if none of these
       environment variables are set, if the locale catalog is not installed, or if grep was not compiled with national language support (NLS).

       GREP_OPTIONS
              This variable specifies default options to be placed in front of any explicit options.  For example, if GREP_OPTIONS is '--binary-files=without-match --directories=skip', grep  behaves
              as  if  the  two  options  --binary-files=without-match  and  --directories=skip  had been specified before any explicit options.  Option specifications are separated by whitespace.  A
              backslash escapes the next character, so it can be used to specify an option containing whitespace or a backslash.

       GREP_COLOR
              This variable specifies the color used to highlight matched (non-empty) text.  It is deprecated in favor of GREP_COLORS, but still supported.   The  mt,  ms,  and  mc  capabilities  of
              GREP_COLORS have priority over it.  It can only specify the color used to highlight the matching non-empty text in any matching line (a selected line when the -v command-line option is
              omitted, or a context line when -v is specified).  The default is 01;31, which means a bold red foreground text on the terminal's default background.

       GREP_COLORS
              Specifies  the  colors  and  other  attributes  used  to  highlight  various  parts  of  the  output.   Its  value  is  a  colon-separated  list  of  capabilities  that   defaults   to
              ms=01;31:mc=01;31:sl=:cx=:fn=35:ln=32:bn=32:se=36 with the rv and ne boolean capabilities omitted (i.e., false).  Supported capabilities are as follows.

              sl=    SGR  substring for whole selected lines (i.e., matching lines when the -v command-line option is omitted, or non-matching lines when -v is specified).  If however the boolean rv
                     capability and the -v command-line option are both specified, it applies to context matching lines instead.  The default is empty (i.e., the terminal's default color pair).

              cx=    SGR substring for whole context lines (i.e., non-matching lines when the -v command-line option is omitted, or matching lines when -v is specified).  If however the  boolean  rv
                     capability and the -v command-line option are both specified, it applies to selected non-matching lines instead.  The default is empty (i.e., the terminal's default color pair).

              rv     Boolean  value  that  reverses  (swaps) the meanings of the sl= and cx= capabilities when the -v command-line option is specified.  The default is false (i.e., the capability is
                     omitted).

              mt=01;31
                     SGR substring for matching non-empty text in any matching line (i.e., a selected line when the -v command-line option is omitted, or  a  context  line  when  -v  is  specified).
                     Setting this is equivalent to setting both ms= and mc= at once to the same value.  The default is a bold red text foreground over the current line background.

              ms=01;31
                     SGR  substring  for matching non-empty text in a selected line.  (This is only used when the -v command-line option is omitted.)  The effect of the sl= (or cx= if rv) capability
                     remains active when this kicks in.  The default is a bold red text foreground over the current line background.

              mc=01;31
                     SGR substring for matching non-empty text in a context line.  (This is only used when the -v command-line option is specified.)  The effect of the cx= (or sl= if rv)  capability
                     remains active when this kicks in.  The default is a bold red text foreground over the current line background.

              fn=35  SGR substring for file names prefixing any content line.  The default is a magenta text foreground over the terminal's default background.

              ln=32  SGR substring for line numbers prefixing any content line.  The default is a green text foreground over the terminal's default background.

              bn=32  SGR substring for byte offsets prefixing any content line.  The default is a green text foreground over the terminal's default background.

              se=36  SGR  substring  for separators that are inserted between selected line fields (:), between context line fields, (-), and between groups of adjacent lines when nonzero context is
                     specified (--).  The default is a cyan text foreground over the terminal's default background.

              ne     Boolean value that prevents clearing to the end of line using Erase in Line (EL) to Right (\33[K) each time a colorized item ends.  This is needed on terminals on  which  EL  is
                     not  supported.   It  is  otherwise  useful on terminals for which the back_color_erase (bce) boolean terminfo capability does not apply, when the chosen highlight colors do not
                     affect the background, or when EL is too slow or causes too much flicker.  The default is false (i.e., the capability is omitted).

              Note that boolean capabilities have no =...  part.  They are omitted (i.e., false) by default and become true when specified.

              See the Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) section in the documentation of the text terminal that is used for permitted values and their meaning as character attributes.   These  substring
              values are integers in decimal representation and can be concatenated with semicolons.  grep takes care of assembling the result into a complete SGR sequence (\33[...m).  Common values
              to concatenate include 1 for bold, 4 for underline, 5 for blink, 7 for inverse, 39 for default foreground color, 30 to 37 for foreground colors, 90 to 97 for 16-color  mode  foreground
              colors,  38;5;0 to 38;5;255 for 88-color and 256-color modes foreground colors, 49 for default background color, 40 to 47 for background colors, 100 to 107 for 16-color mode background
              colors, and 48;5;0 to 48;5;255 for 88-color and 256-color modes background colors.

       LC_ALL, LC_COLLATE, LANG
              These variables specify the locale for the LC_COLLATE category, which determines the collating sequence used to interpret range expressions like [a-z].

       LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, LANG
              These variables specify the locale for the LC_CTYPE category, which determines the type of characters, e.g., which characters are whitespace.

       LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES, LANG
              These variables specify the locale for the LC_MESSAGES category, which determines the language that grep uses for messages.  The default C locale uses American English messages.

       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              If set, grep behaves as POSIX requires; otherwise, grep behaves more like other GNU programs.  POSIX requires that options that follow file names must be  treated  as  file  names;  by
              default,  such  options  are  permuted to the front of the operand list and are treated as options.  Also, POSIX requires that unrecognized options be diagnosed as “illegal”, but since
              they are not really against the law the default is to diagnose them as “invalid”.  POSIXLY_CORRECT also disables _N_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_, described below.

       _N_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_
              (Here N is grep's numeric process ID.)  If the ith character of this environment variable's value is 1, do not consider the ith operand of grep to be an option, even if it  appears  to
              be  one.   A shell can put this variable in the environment for each command it runs, specifying which operands are the results of file name wildcard expansion and therefore should not
              be treated as options.  This behavior is available only with the GNU C library, and only when POSIXLY_CORRECT is not set.

EXIT STATUS
       Normally, the exit status is 0 if selected lines are found and 1 otherwise.  But the exit status is 2 if an error occurred, unless the -q or --quiet or --silent option is used and a  selected
       line  is found.  Note, however, that POSIX only mandates, for programs such as grep, cmp, and diff, that the exit status in case of error be greater than 1; it is therefore advisable, for the
       sake of portability, to use logic that tests for this general condition instead of strict equality with 2.

       <http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=grep>.

   Known Bugs
       Large  repetition counts in the {n,m} construct may cause grep to use lots of memory.  In addition, certain other obscure regular expressions require exponential time and space, and may cause
       grep to run out of memory.

       Back-references are very slow, and may require exponential time.

NAME
       cp - copy files and directories

SYNOPSIS
       cp [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
       cp [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
       cp [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...

DESCRIPTION
       Copy SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --archive
              same as -dR --preserve=all

       --attributes-only
              don't copy the file data, just the attributes

       --backup[=CONTROL]
              make a backup of each existing destination file

       -b     like --backup but does not accept an argument

       --copy-contents
              copy contents of special files when recursive

       -d     same as --no-dereference --preserve=links

       -f, --force
              if an existing destination file cannot be opened, remove it and try again (this option is ignored when the -n option is also used)

       -i, --interactive
              prompt before overwrite (overrides a previous -n option)

       -H     follow command-line symbolic links in SOURCE

       -l, --link
              hard link files instead of copying

       -L, --dereference
              always follow symbolic links in SOURCE

       -n, --no-clobber
              do not overwrite an existing file (overrides a previous -i option)

       -P, --no-dereference
              never follow symbolic links in SOURCE

       -p     same as --preserve=mode,ownership,timestamps

       --preserve[=ATTR_LIST]
              preserve the specified attributes (default: mode,ownership,timestamps), if possible additional attributes: context, links, xattr, all

       -c     deprecated, same as --preserve=context

       --no-preserve=ATTR_LIST
              don't preserve the specified attributes

       --parents
              use full source file name under DIRECTORY

       -R, -r, --recursive
              copy directories recursively

       --reflink[=WHEN]
              control clone/CoW copies. See below

       --remove-destination
              remove each existing destination file before attempting to open it (contrast with --force)

       --sparse=WHEN
              control creation of sparse files. See below

       --strip-trailing-slashes
              remove any trailing slashes from each SOURCE argument

       -s, --symbolic-link
              make symbolic links instead of copying

       -S, --suffix=SUFFIX
              override the usual backup suffix

       -t, --target-directory=DIRECTORY
              copy all SOURCE arguments into DIRECTORY

       -T, --no-target-directory
              treat DEST as a normal file

       -u, --update
              copy only when the SOURCE file is newer than the destination file or when the destination file is missing

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       -x, --one-file-system
              stay on this file system

       -Z     set SELinux security context of destination file to default type

       --context[=CTX]
              like -Z, or if CTX is specified then set the SELinux or SMACK security context to CTX

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       By  default,  sparse  SOURCE  files  are  detected  by  a  crude  heuristic  and  the corresponding DEST file is made sparse as well.  That is the behavior selected by --sparse=auto.  Specify
       --sparse=always to create a sparse DEST file whenever the SOURCE file contains a long enough sequence of zero bytes.  Use --sparse=never to inhibit creation of sparse files.

       When --reflink[=always] is specified, perform a lightweight copy, where the data blocks are copied only when modified.  If this is not possible the copy fails, or if --reflink=auto is  speci‐
       fied, fall back to a standard copy.

       The  backup  suffix  is  '~',  unless set with --suffix or SIMPLE_BACKUP_SUFFIX.  The version control method may be selected via the --backup option or through the VERSION_CONTROL environment
       variable.  Here are the values:

       none, off
              never make backups (even if --backup is given)

       numbered, t
              make numbered backups

       existing, nil
              numbered if numbered backups exist, simple otherwise

       simple, never
              always make simple backups

       As a special case, cp makes a backup of SOURCE when the force and backup options are given and SOURCE and DEST are the same name for an existing, regular file.

NAME
       rm - remove files or directories

SYNOPSIS
       rm [OPTION]... FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       This manual page documents the GNU version of rm.  rm removes each specified file.  By default, it does not remove directories.

       If  the  -I or --interactive=once option is given, and there are more than three files or the -r, -R, or --recursive are given, then rm prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire
       operation.  If the response is not affirmative, the entire command is aborted.

       Otherwise, if a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and the -f or --force option is not given, or the -i or --interactive=always option is given, rm prompts the user for whether
       to remove the file.  If the response is not affirmative, the file is skipped.

OPTIONS
       Remove (unlink) the FILE(s).

       -f, --force
              ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt

       -i     prompt before every removal

       -I     prompt once before removing more than three files, or when removing recursively; less intrusive than -i, while still giving protection against most mistakes

       --interactive[=WHEN]
              prompt according to WHEN: never, once (-I), or always (-i); without WHEN, prompt always

       --one-file-system
              when removing a hierarchy recursively, skip any directory that is on a file system different from that of the corresponding command line argument

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat '/' specially

       --preserve-root
              do not remove '/' (default)

       -r, -R, --recursive
              remove directories and their contents recursively

       -d, --dir
              remove empty directories

       -v, --verbose
              explain what is being done

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       By default, rm does not remove directories.  Use the --recursive (-r or -R) option to remove each listed directory, too, along with all of its contents.

       To remove a file whose name starts with a '-', for example '-foo', use one of these commands:

              rm -- -foo

              rm ./-foo

       Note  that  if  you  use  rm to remove a file, it might be possible to recover some of its contents, given sufficient expertise and/or time.  For greater assurance that the contents are truly
       unrecoverable, consider using shred.

NAME
       chmod - change file mode bits

SYNOPSIS
       chmod [OPTION]... MODE[,MODE]... FILE...
       chmod [OPTION]... OCTAL-MODE FILE...
       chmod [OPTION]... --reference=RFILE FILE...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual page documents the GNU version of chmod.  chmod changes the file mode bits of each given file according to mode, which can be either a symbolic representation of changes to make,
       or an octal number representing the bit pattern for the new mode bits.

       The format of a symbolic mode is [ugoa...][[+-=][perms...]...], where perms is either zero or more letters from the set rwxXst, or a single letter from the set ugo.  Multiple  symbolic  modes
       can be given, separated by commas.

       A  combination of the letters ugoa controls which users' access to the file will be changed: the user who owns it (u), other users in the file's group (g), other users not in the file's group
       (o), or all users (a).  If none of these are given, the effect is as if a were given, but bits that are set in the umask are not affected.

       The operator + causes the selected file mode bits to be added to the existing file mode bits of each file; - causes them to be removed; and = causes them to be added  and  causes  unmentioned
       bits to be removed except that a directory's unmentioned set user and group ID bits are not affected.

       The  letters  rwxXst  select file mode bits for the affected users: read (r), write (w), execute (or search for directories) (x), execute/search only if the file is a directory or already has
       execute permission for some user (X), set user or group ID on execution (s), restricted deletion flag or sticky bit (t).  Instead of one or more of these letters, you can specify exactly  one
       of  the  letters ugo: the permissions granted to the user who owns the file (u), the permissions granted to other users who are members of the file's group (g), and the permissions granted to
       users that are in neither of the two preceding categories (o).

       A numeric mode is from one to four octal digits (0-7), derived by adding up the bits with values 4, 2, and 1.  Omitted digits are assumed to be leading zeros.  The first digit selects the set
       user  ID (4) and set group ID (2) and restricted deletion or sticky (1) attributes.  The second digit selects permissions for the user who owns the file: read (4), write (2), and execute (1);
       the third selects permissions for other users in the file's group, with the same values; and the fourth for other users not in the file's group, with the same values.

       chmod never changes the permissions of symbolic links; the chmod system call cannot change their permissions.  This is not a problem since the permissions of symbolic links  are  never  used.
       However,  for  each  symbolic  link  listed  on the command line, chmod changes the permissions of the pointed-to file.  In contrast, chmod ignores symbolic links encountered during recursive
       directory traversals.

SETUID AND SETGID BITS
       chmod clears the set-group-ID bit of a regular file if the file's group ID does not match the user's effective group ID or one of the user's supplementary  group  IDs,  unless  the  user  has
       appropriate  privileges.  Additional restrictions may cause the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of MODE or RFILE to be ignored.  This behavior depends on the policy and functionality of the
       underlying chmod system call.  When in doubt, check the underlying system behavior.

       chmod preserves a directory's set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits unless you explicitly specify otherwise.  You can set or clear the bits with symbolic modes like u+s and g-s, and you  can  set
       (but not clear) the bits with a numeric mode.

RESTRICTED DELETION FLAG OR STICKY BIT
       The restricted deletion flag or sticky bit is a single bit, whose interpretation depends on the file type.  For directories, it prevents unprivileged users from removing or renaming a file in
       the directory unless they own the file or the directory; this is called the restricted deletion flag for the directory, and is commonly found on world-writable  directories  like  /tmp.   For
       regular files on some older systems, the bit saves the program's text image on the swap device so it will load more quickly when run; this is called the sticky bit.

OPTIONS
       Change the mode of each FILE to MODE.  With --reference, change the mode of each FILE to that of RFILE.

       -c, --changes
              like verbose but report only when a change is made

       -f, --silent, --quiet
              suppress most error messages

       -v, --verbose
              output a diagnostic for every file processed

       --no-preserve-root
              do not treat '/' specially (the default)

       --preserve-root
              fail to operate recursively on '/'

       --reference=RFILE
              use RFILE's mode instead of MODE values

       -R, --recursive
              change files and directories recursively

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Each MODE is of the form '[ugoa]*([-+=]([rwxXst]*|[ugo]))+|[-+=][0-7]+'.
